## About the Project

The Titanic dataset is one of the most popular beginner datasets for machine learning and data analysis.  
In this project, the goal is to:
- Understand key factors that influenced passenger survival
- Clean and preprocess the data
- Build a machine learning model to predict survival
- Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance

The main machine learning algorithm used in this project is **Decision Tree Classifier**.

  - Visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
  - Understanding the relationship between features and survival.
- **Feature Engineering:**
  - Converting categorical variables into numeric formats.
- **Model Building:**
  - Splitting data into training and testing sets.
  - Building a Decision Tree Classifier.
- **Model Evaluation:**
  - Checking model accuracy on the test set.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd your-repository-name
    ```
3. Install required libraries (if not already installed):
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn 
    ```
4. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Taitanic.ipynb
    ```

## Results

The Decision Tree Classifier achieved a decent accuracy on the test data.  
The EDA revealed several important insights, such as:
- Female passengers had a much higher survival rate.
- Younger passengers had higher survival rates.
- First-class passengers had higher survival rates compared to second- and third-class passengers.
